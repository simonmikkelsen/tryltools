Stmbs is Search Tool Made By Simon and is a going-to-be desktop
indexer and search tool made in Python.

Currently sqlite3 is used as database, preparations for a general
interface has been made. It should also be able to index lots of
file types and from other sources than a file structure.

Lots of changes happens - don't count on anything being stable.
