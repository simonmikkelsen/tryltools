Tryltools is a collection of personal utilities and projects from about 2008. They are not developed or maintained.

A few, such as cmd/fullpath is still in use in my personal script collection.
As of writing I hope to find the time to organize the most useable parts of my personal script collection and release them in a new reposotory.
