mmv is a *nix command line utility written in Python.
It is short for mass move, or mass rename and can rename
multiple files in one command, based on rules specified
on the command line.

The current version is not finished, and will only print
what it will do - not do any actual renaming.

The software is GPL3 by Simon Mikkelsen, http://mikkelsen.tv/simon/
It is part of tryltools, which is currently hosted at

Please send bug reports, feature suggestions and most of all
code :-)
